"""
A bug that eats moves and reproduces.
    Bug consumes food keeps size similar as cell
    Bugs has gender, only female bugs reproduces. There's equal chance of generating a male or a female bug. (think about how to do mix and generate new feature here, maybe start with changing parameters first)
    Think about how to make some noise for bugs to communicate.
    Bugs move in a 2d map to search for food. Food generates smell and bug has instinct to get the direction of food.
    Food can be consumed but new food generates at certain rate.
